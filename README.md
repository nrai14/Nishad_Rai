# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

For the third week of bootcamp, I re-created my original website development portfolio utilising BootStrap. Each section was built from components from Bootstrap with elements of custom HTML/CSS to resemble as much of the original design as possible. 

This task was key to understanding the importance of utilising BootStrap and building confidence/familiarity with it. 

The portfolio successfully loads with:

*A page that has a Navigation Bar built using a BootStrap component
*The Navigation Menu includes links that lead to the respective sections of my portfolio page 
*The Hero section was recreated with using a Jumbotron component that features my picture, my name and my title
*The works/projects section displays my (future) work in a grid. BootStrap cards have been used to create each project part and each of them has a title and a brief overview
*The skills section is something that has been added, it lists out the skills I expect to learn from Bootcamp. I have utilised FontAwesome icons to add more visual appeal. 
*As per requirements, the About Me section and the Contact section are now in the same row 
*The footer section has been updated with all hyperlinks now displaying a hover effect, with buttons displaying a box shadow upon hover
*BootStrap allowed me to minimize use of media queries, however some were used for cleaner responsive design 
*Other elements of my original portfolio that are also present here are: smooth UI scrolling when links are clicked and image of project taking user to deployed application (currently still my GitHub repo).


* A page that presents my name, photo and links to sections about myself, my projects and a contact form
* The UI scrolls smoothly when links are clicked to navigate to the corresponding section
* Each work section contains titled placeholders and images for future applications
* Hovering over an image of the application results in a larger image being displayed 
* Upon being clicked, the image will take the user to the deployed application (currently linked to my GitHub repo, which will be updated, accordingly)
